> Introduction

Social networks and websites such as Yelp are becoming increasingly popular as we advance into a digitalised era. Nowadays, the growing reliance of individuals on these sites to make decisions indicates an upward trend to confront the relevance of user reviews and ratings. When navigating on Yelp, a business’ star rating is indisputably a decisive factor that users consider when making consumption decisions. Therefore, this paper aims to leverage the data features extracted from Yelp datasets to train, test the model, and predict the star ratings that individuals assign to businesses. This is achieved via the employment of Random Forest and consecutive assessment of the model’s performance.

The data science methodology adopted in this paper is the widely implemented Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, a framework introduced in 1999, for its flexibility and adaptability to data science projects. It also allows beginner data scientists undertake research via a standardised structure. Additionally, from the comparative study of data mining process models, Shafique and Qaiser (2014) implicitly suggest how CRISP-DM outstands similar data science methodologies such as KDD and SEMMA by including all steps with fewer phases, streamlining the process. However, as previously outlined in the lectures, there is a potential inefficiency in teamwork or when working with stakeholders. Nonetheless, since this report consists of an individual task, these challenges can be neglected.

Overall, this report is structured as follows: starting with this Introduction or Business Understanding, Dataset Characteristics (with Data Understanding and Data Preparation), Modeling, and Evaluation. Finally, we conclude by summarising the limitations and challenges found during the research. Like many other papers, due to unclear instructions for future use, this paper will exclude the deployment phase.

```

In this research, we employed two Yelp datasets with 1398056 reviews given by 397579 users, accessible from the Yelp website. Both the user data and the review data are in rda format.

For an overview of the features, we merged the user data and the review data by matching the ‘user_id’ data frames to obtain the ‘merged_data’, encompassing review ratings, user characteristics, and engagement variables. Additionally, the columns that might be most influential to user ratings were selected and a correlation matrix for all these features in the merged_data was imputed accordingly (Figure 3), resulting in a dataset comprised of 279878 observations and 19 variables.

```{r merged_data, echo=TRUE}
merged_data <- review_data_small %>%
  inner_join(user_data_small, by = "user_id")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
str(merged_data)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
#Select columns that might be relevant
merged_data <- merged_data %>%
  select(stars, review_count, useful.x, funny.x, cool.x, 
         elite, fans, average_stars, compliment_hot, compliment_more, 
         compliment_profile, compliment_cute, compliment_list, compliment_note, 
         compliment_plain, compliment_cool, compliment_funny, compliment_writer, 
         compliment_photos)
```

```{r obs merged_data, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
dim(merged_data) #279878 observations and 19 variables
```

Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of user review counts on a logarithmic scale to deal with the disparate orders of magnitude, extending from users with very few reviews to those with thousands and more:

```{r , echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
#Count the number who gave reviews and the number of users who didn't
users_without_reviews <- merged_data %>%
  filter(review_count == 0)
users_with_reviews <- merged_data %>%
  filter(review_count > 0)
```

```{r summary_table, echo=FALSE}
#Create a summary table for review_count
summary_table <- data.frame(
  Category = c("Users with Reviews", "Users without Reviews"),
  Count = c(nrow(users_with_reviews), nrow(users_without_reviews))  )
```

```{r kable_summary, echo=FALSE}
kable(summary_table, format = "markdown")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Distribution of review count and plot a pie chart to illustrate
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = review_count)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "tomato", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Figure 1. Distribution Review Count (in logs)",
       x = "Number of Reviews (in log)",
       y = "Number of Users")  +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format())
```

The histogram shows that most users contribute a limited number of reviews, with around 40,000 users in the peak frequency category (log 1). Around 116,000 individuals engage actively in the long tail effect (log (10)). Logically, the higher the logarithmic ranges (log (100) and (log (1000)), the lower the review counts. Four users without reviews were excluded from the plot since it is not possible to take logs of values of 0. 

Key data preprocessing steps consists of the following: First, no missing data was found. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
sum(is.na(merged_data))
```

Second, for the variable ‘elite’, missing values were transformed into a binary numeric variable equal to 1 if a non-empty string, 0 otherwise, followed by the conversion from categorical to a numerical feature.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
#'elite'
merged_data$elite <- ifelse(merged_data$elite != "", 1, 0)
merged_data$elite <- as.numeric(merged_data$elite)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
str(merged_data$elite)
```

To our interest, even though the ‘compliment’ variables have many values equal to 0, it is sensible to keep these as they may contain relevant information. Consequently, we want to build a model that both ensures robustness and detects key characteristics of the data in times when users received no compliments.

We then look at the distribution of review ratings. Figure 2 reveals a moderate skewness of the review distributions to the 4- and 5-star categories. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
##Distribution of stars in merged_data
table(merged_data$stars)
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = stars, fill = stars)) +
  geom_bar(color = "black") +
  geom_text(
    stat = "count",
    aes(label = after_stat(count)),
    position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
    color = "black",
    size = 3 ) +
  labs(title = "Figure 2. Distribution of Stars Rating", x = "Stars", y = "Number of Reviews") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format())

summary(merged_data$stars)
```

Woolf (2014) corroborated to this result by elucidating that Yelp reviews tend to exhibit optimistic bias in the long run. According to Cunningham (2021), this may lead to a “positivity problem” for consumers who rely on the business’ star ratings to make consumption decisions, which requires careful attention.

Then, a correlation matrix has been plotted to interpret different patterns in merged_data. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
#Calculate the correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(merged_data[, sapply(merged_data, is.numeric)])
print(cor_matrix)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Visual representation of the correlation matrix
corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "color", tl.col = "black", tl.cex = 0.7)
title("Figure 3. Correlation Matrix")
```

The interpretation of the heatmap begins by stating that the large number of coefficients with values close to zero potentially evidence non-linear patterns in the data. We can also infer a positive correlation of 0.58 between ‘stars’ (review ratings), and ‘average_stars’ (average stars rating of a user), such that higher star ratings are linked to better user interactions. Furthermore, a positive relationship between popularity (‘fans’) with the number of reviews (‘review_count’) for a coefficient of 0.66, and engagement (‘compliment_note’, ‘compliment_plain’, ‘compliment_funny’ for coefficients of 0.53, 0.67, 0.60 respectively, just to name a few) can also be deduced from the heatmap.

To select the features to fit into the predictive model, we utilised the Recursive Feature Elimination or RFE with cross-validation, since this predictor selection method decreases overfitting, thereby increasing accuracy (Gomede, 2023). RFE fits the model across all columns of the data, then prunes features with less ‘weight’ at each iteration, leaving us with the optimal subset of predictors. This method’s efficiency has been further corroborated by Guyon et al. (2002) in their study of gene selection for cancer classification. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
#First convert the dependent variable (stars) to factor type
merged_data$stars <- as.factor(merged_data$stars)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
set.seed(123)  
sampled_data <- merged_data[sample(nrow(merged_data), 2000), ] #create sample to increase speed

#Employment of the recursive feature elimination to select the relevant features
control <- rfeControl(functions=rfFuncs, method="cv", number=5)
results <- rfe(sampled_data[, -which(names(sampled_data) == "stars")], sampled_data$stars, sizes=c(1:5), rfeControl=control)
```

> Modelling

To predict the number of stars a user has given to another business, we trained the random forest model after a thorough consideration of the efficiency of the model in preventing overfitting and performing well when coping with large datasets. The resulting optimal five features are ‘average_stars’, ‘fans’, ‘review_count’, ‘useful.x’, and ‘compliment_note’ (specific meanings can be found in the R script)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(results)

#Select optimal features
opt_features <- results$optVariables
opt_features
```

According to the requirements of this assignment, we split merged user-reviews data into training and testing data, both with 19 variables and 160003 and 39997 observations, respectively, following the 80-20 rule, which is commonly accredited as the split that yields the best results (Gholamy et al., 2018).

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
#Split into testing and training data
set.seed(1)
data <- merged_data[sample(nrow(merged_data), 200000), ] #sample a subset of 200,000 observations increase the speed in training the model.
splitIndex <- createDataPartition(data$stars, p = 0.8, list = FALSE) #since the merged data has 279878 obs, we can increase the number of observations while generating the testing data to enhance performance.
training_data <- data[splitIndex, ]
testing_data <- data[-splitIndex, ]
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
dim(testing_data)
dim(training_data) 
```

> Evaluation

Consequently, a random forest model has been trained using the ‘best’ predictors derived from RFE. This approach was supplemented by cross-validation to ensure robustness throughout.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Train the Random Forest model
rf_model <- randomForest(stars ~ ., data = training_data[, c(opt_features, "stars")], ntree = 100, mtry = 3) #100 trees, three features at each split. 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(rf_model)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Predict the number of stars
predictions <- predict(rf_model, testing_data[, opt_features])

# Evaluate the predictions derived from model
confusionMatrix(predictions, testing_data$stars)

```

From the table, we can infer moderate accuracy in the model performance with an estimated error rate of 45.2%. Besides, the statistical outcome from the confusion matrix evidence that the applied machine learning model yielded correct predictions for around 54.93% of the overall data. Another  key statistic is the Kappa value of 0.2929, suggesting a fair reliability, according to Landis and Koch’s (1977) interpretation. Therefore, the model demonstrated fluctuating sensitivity and specificity across different star classes or ratings, which define the true positive and true negative rate respectively, excelling in the prediction of higher star ratings, e.g., 5-star ratings, with 84.16% sensitivity. Thus, we conclude that the model predicts stars reasonably, but could possibly be enhanced for 2 and 3-star ratings.


> Conclusion

As a result of the increasing popularity of social networks like Yelp, researchers have widely applied datasets to establish nexus between attributes that are influential in the number of stars users give to businesses. Nevertheless, the large size of the provided files has substantially increased the time needed to preprocess the data, select the optimal variables, and train the random forest model. Results point to a moderate prediction accuracy of 54.93%, which calls for further optimisation of the predicting model. Some further steps could be either including sentiment analysis to extrapolate the meaning behind text reviews, investigating the relevance of features from the other three Yelp datasets, experimenting with other models, or a combination of all three.
